## Brainstorming Prompts for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
We talked about how to design and build a platform that allow developers to more explicily showing how they use user's information. I think it is very interesting because privacy concern is a problem that require attention from all the companies.
We concluded different data flow and data interactions between developers and users.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
We might going to continue investigate the privacy platform that eventually allow developers to show their data flow and data interactions to user. Our mentor's PHD students are collaberating with us to come up with a comprehensive design. But if it turns out the design doesn't meet our mentor's expectation, we could potential change the investigation like how to integrate LLM power into this privacy platform.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
As it is a very open ended project, our mentor encourages us to explore other related area of this project like deployment. I think if I am going to have any other potential changes, it would be topic like how to integrate LLM power into this privacy platform. At end of the day, we want to build something that can translate developers codes into the dataflow gram directly. But this is a very complicate process, we definitely still need to have more investigation

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
React, Typescript, MongoDB, github action, maybe some other deploying platform. We are primarily using MERN stack for now. But could potentially change/add new tech stack into this project when is needed.
