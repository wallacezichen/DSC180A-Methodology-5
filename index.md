## Brainstorming Prompts for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
We talked about how to design and build a platform that allow developers to more explicily showing how they use user's information. I think it is very interesting because privacy concern is a problem that require attention from all the companies.
We concluded different data flow and data interactions between developers and users.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
We might going to continue investigate the privacy platform that eventually allow developers to show their data flow and data interactions to user.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I do not think there will be any potential changes. This is a very open ended project. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
React, Typescript, MongoDB, github action, maybe some other deploying platform.
